# hi Frontend Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Introduction

### Background
The "hi" project is a basic Next.js frontend built using the App Router. It currently renders a minimal single page with global styles and is configured for static export. This PRD defines the initial functional and non-functional requirements to evolve the project into a polished single-page application following the Ocean Professional theme with blue and amber accents.

### Scope
This PRD covers the user experience and feature requirements for the frontend only. It focuses on a single-page layout consisting of a header, a main content area, and a footer. It includes styling guidance, accessibility expectations, performance targets, and extensibility requirements. Backend or API components are out of scope unless explicitly noted as placeholders for future integration.

## Target Users

### Primary Users
- Visitors and evaluators who need a clean, modern landing experience to understand the product identity “hi.”
- Stakeholders and developers reviewing the project’s design system and frontend baseline.

### Secondary Users
- Future end-users who will interact with additional features as the product evolves.

## Goals and Non-Goals

### Goals
- Provide a modern, minimalist single-page interface with a clear header, hero-style main content, and a concise footer.
- Apply the Ocean Professional theme consistently with blue (#2563EB) as primary and amber (#F59E0B) as accent.
- Ensure accessibility, responsiveness, and a clean, maintainable codebase using Next.js 15 and Tailwind CSS v4.

### Non-Goals
- Implement multi-page navigation or complex state management at this stage.
- Integrate external APIs beyond placeholders.

## Key Features

### 1. Branded Header
A responsive header that includes:
- Project name (“hi”) as the brand.
- Optional right-aligned call-to-action (CTA) button styled with amber accent for emphasis.
- Sticky behavior on scroll is optional but recommended if content grows.

Acceptance:
- Header renders on all viewport sizes without layout shifts.
- Focus states are visible and meet contrast standards.

### 2. Main Content (Hero Section)
A centered hero with:
- Title using Ocean Professional theme typography and color palette.
- Subtitle/strapline explaining the purpose in one sentence.
- Primary CTA button (amber accent) with hover/focus transitions.
- Optional secondary link styled with blue outline or subtle underlines.

Acceptance:
- Typography is legible across mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- Buttons and links have clear hover, focus, and active states.
- Content uses a subtle gradient background (from-blue-500/10 to-gray-50) behind the hero container when supported.

### 3. Footer
A simple footer with:
- Copyright.
- Minimalist links (e.g., “Privacy,” “Terms,” placeholder routes) with reduced prominence.
- Light top border or subtle divider.

Acceptance:
- Footer is visible and accessible on all screen sizes.
- Links are keyboard navigable and have focus styles.

### 4. Not Found Page
A friendly 404 page aligned with theme:
- Title, short explanation, and link back to home.
- Semantic structure and ARIA live region where appropriate.

Acceptance:
- 404 page matches color palette and typography.
- Passed keyboard-only navigation checks.

## UI/UX Requirements

### Visual Design
- Theme: Modern, minimalist with subtle shadows and rounded corners.
- Colors:
  - Primary: #2563EB (blue)
  - Secondary: #F59E0B (amber)
  - Success: #F59E0B (per style guide)
  - Error: #EF4444
  - Background: #f9fafb
  - Surface: #ffffff
  - Text: #111827
- Accents: Amber used judiciously for CTAs and highlights.
- Gradients: Apply subtle gradient backgrounds (from-blue-500/10 to-gray-50) where it adds depth without distraction.
- Motion: Smooth transitions on hover/focus (150–250ms). Avoid large motion that could cause discomfort.

### Layout
- Single-page structure: Header, main, footer.
- Container widths: Constrain content to readable widths (e.g., max-w-screen-lg) with balanced spacing.
- Responsiveness: Mobile-first, scale up to large screens with consistent vertical rhythm.

### Typography
- Use system defaults or Geist (if added) for clean, modern appearance.
- Hierarchy: H1 for title, H2 for section titles, body text with sufficient line height (1.5–1.7).
- Contrast: Meet WCAG 2.1 AA minimum contrast for text and UI components.

### Accessibility
- Keyboard navigable with visible focus indicators.
- Semantic HTML (header, main, footer, nav, buttons/links).
- ARIA is used sparingly and appropriately.
- Color contrast compliance for primary, secondary, and text colors.

## Technical Requirements

### Tech Stack
- Framework: Next.js 15 (App Router)
- Language: TypeScript (strict mode enabled)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS v4 via @tailwindcss/postcss
- Build: Static export enabled (next.config.ts output: "export")
- Linting: ESLint with next/core-web-vitals and next/typescript configs

### Performance and Quality
- Lighthouse Performance ≥ 90 on a representative hero page.
- CLS < 0.1; stable layout with pre-defined dimensions where applicable.
- Use semantic and accessible components to reduce a11y violations.

### Extensibility
- Encapsulate theme tokens in CSS variables and/or Tailwind config where applicable.
- Organize structure to scale into modular components for header, hero, and footer.
- Keep global styles minimal and rely on utility classes for consistency.

## Content Requirements

### Copy
- Title: “hi”
- Subtitle: Short sentence communicating purpose, e.g., “A modern, minimalist starting point.”
- CTA: “Get Started” (primary) and optional “Learn More” (secondary)

### Metadata
- Page title and description should reflect the product identity and be configurable.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The header, main hero, and footer are present, responsive, and themed.
- Primary actions are discoverable with consistent hover/focus styles using the accent.
- Global styles reflect the Ocean Professional palette and background/surface settings.
- The 404 page follows the same design language.
- Linting passes with current ESLint config.
- Build works with static export.

## Risks and Mitigations

- Risk: Palette drift from theme tokens. Mitigation: Centralize tokens and reference them consistently.
- Risk: Accessibility regressions. Mitigation: Introduce automated a11y checks (future).
- Risk: Static-only limits dynamic features. Mitigation: Maintain API placeholders and design components to evolve.

## Milestones

1. Themed Layout Foundations
   - Implement header, hero, footer with Ocean Professional styling.
   - Align globals.css tokens to the theme.

2. Interaction and A11y Polish
   - Focus/hover states, keyboard navigation, and color contrast checks.

3. Content and Metadata
   - Adjustable copy and metadata via metadata object in layout/page.

## References
- Package.json, Next.js 15, Tailwind v4 configuration, current app directory structure.
